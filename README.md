## About
This repository contains the text for the Smallgroups.church website. If you (or your church) is interested in translating this into your language, please follow the instructions below.

## Instructions
1. Create a [github.com](https://github.com/join) account
  - Complete account information in Step 1.
  - Select `Unlimited public repositories for free.` in Step 2.
  - Click the `skip this step` link at the bottom of Step 3.
  - Verify your email address -- you'll need to do this before you can modify files in step 2 below.
  - Come back to this repository [https://github.com/1thrasher/smallgroups-i18n](https://github.com/1thrasher/smallgroups-i18n)

2. Find the file that you would like to edit (under your language) in the file listings above. (If your language is not listed, please contact us at hello@smallgroups.church.)
  - Select the file you want to modify
  - Click the pencil icon in the top-right that says, 'Fork this project and edit the file'.
  - Make the necessary translation updates:
  
     When editing the files, **do not** modify any of the text inside of curly braces. For example, you would not translate the word name in the following `What is your {{name}}?`.

     When editing the \*.json file, **do not** modify any of the CAPITALIZED keys, rather only translate the text in quotes to the right of the colon (:) of each key.
     
     At any time, click the 'Preview changes' button at the top to see your updates.

3. After completing your translations, preview your changes to ensure correctness.
4. At the bottom of the screen you will see a 'Propose file change' form. Enter a short, one-line description of your updates in the first box, and (if necessary) an extended description in the second box.
5. Click the 'Propose file change' button.
